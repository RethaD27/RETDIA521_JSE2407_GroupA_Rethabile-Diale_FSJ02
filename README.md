### Explanation of Root Files:

- **layout.js**:  
   This file defines the primary layout for your application, including shared components like the header and footer. It wraps around all other pages and ensures consistency in the UI design across different routes.

- **loading.js**:  
   Responsible for showing a loading spinner or indicator while the content or data is being fetched. This file enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback during loading states.

- **page.js**:  
   The main page file for rendering the homepage content. This file is used as the entry point for the application's homepage, where it integrates components like `FilterSort`, `ProductGrid`, and `Pagination`.
